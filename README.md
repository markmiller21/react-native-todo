# react-native-todo
React Native Project that leverages the movie database API to display some of the best rated new movies

This project was created as an example project for a talk on React Native that I gave at Solution in June of 2016.  The app is a fully functional todo list crossplatform application.  I used realm as a database to enable users to save varoius todos.

Once saved, each todo is displayed in a ListView sorted by a completed boolean.  Each todo can be deleted or marked as completed.

I used React version 15.0.2, react-native version 0.26.3, and realm version 0.13.2
